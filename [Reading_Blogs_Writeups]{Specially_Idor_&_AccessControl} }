KEYPOINT: 
1. IDOR VIA HTTP PARAMETER POLLUTION
2. There was not SQLI or XSS so the tester moved towards IDOR 

ACTUAL STORY: 
1. The tester already first test for serveral other bugs like xss,sqli they didnot found it.
2. They initially also test for an IDOR by manipulating IDs they were not able to found that too ----> IDs manipulate garara idor khojyo but vetana suru tira
3. At final the tester found a critical bug IDOR  exploting via HTTP Parameter Pollution --> last ma chai idor vetyo through HPP 
4.  Bypassing ACLs â€“ IDOR exploitation via HPP:
     4.1 Tried with maniputaing with IDs no luck
     4.2 Now tried with HPP --> this simply means adding another parameter as the same name with the existing parameter, in this case the parameter was customer id.
     4.3 The name shoudl be the exact, so the testers look the JSON response and found out it was :"CustomerId" key.
     4.4 Now they add a new parameter called: CustomerId: <customer_ids>, with a GET request
          4.4.1 The request look like: GET /api/a/b/c/random/stuff/v1/23923017/again/random/stuff/CustomerId=23923017 --> this leaks the PII data throgh HPP   
5. So till now the testers are able to still the PII of another customer by simply adding a GET parameter with the name customerid and a random integer value.
6. This was the systematic issue that affect the API from idor via hpp.
7. Again the tester were able to exploited the /addresses/<<customerid>> endpoint to leak all the registered addresses of any customer.
8. Now the developers fixed it and the testers were able to bypass it again: 
   8.1 Bypassing the fix: 
      8.1.1 Still there are many parameter that were vulnerable to previous exploit
      8.1.2 One simple way to bypass it is to: Change parameter from GET to POST  --> this is with some limited info only no PII leak hai 
9. So the logic and main issue is: if there is no idor with simple manipulating ids go with the http parameter pollution as well.
